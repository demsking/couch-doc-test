msgid "The default query server is written in :ref:`JavaScript <query-server/js>`, running via `Mozilla SpiderMonkey`_. You can use other languages by setting a Query server key in the ``language`` property of a design document or the `Content-Type` header of a `temporary view`. Design documents that do not specify a ``language`` property are assumed to be of type `javascript`, as are ad hoc queries that are POSTed to :ref:`_temp_view <api/db/temp_view>` without a `Content-Type` header."
