For example it would be silly to use keys that are hundreds of characters long, but your program would be hard to maintain if you only used single character keys. Carefully consider data that is duplicated by putting it in views."

Most APIs have some mechanism to do batches, usually by supplying lists of documents or keys in the request body. Be careful what size you pick for the batches. The larger batch requires more time your client has to spend encoding the items into JSON and more time is spent decoding that number of responses. Do some benchmarking with your own configuration and typical data to find the sweet spot. It is likely to be between one and ten thousand documents."

The main reason is that this release ships with the more recent version of the HTTP server library Mochiweb, which by default sets the TCP socket option `SO_NODELAY`_ to false. This means that small data sent to the TCP socket, like the reply to a document write request (or reading a very small document), will not be sent immediately to the network - TCP will buffer it for a while hoping that it will be asked to send more data through the same socket and then send all the data at once for increased performance. This TCP buffering behaviour can be disabled via :config:option:`httpd/socket_options`:"

This revision will remain even after a `database compaction` so that the deletion can be replicated. Deleted documents, like non-deleted documents, can affect view build times, :method:`PUT` and :method:`DELETE` requests time and size of database on disk, since they increase the size of the B+Tree's. You can see the number of deleted documents in :get:`database information </{db}>`. If your use case creates lots of deleted documents (for example, if you are storing short-term data like logfile entries, message queues, etc), you might want to periodically switch to a new database and delete the old one (once the entries in it have all expired)."
